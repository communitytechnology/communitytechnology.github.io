##Facilitation for Community Involvment

Community input and buy-in is one of the most important elements in community organizing. Neighborhood meet-ups or community meetings can be tricky to navigate with so many personalities and experiences at the table. Good facilitation is a key component to getting people excite the ball rolling and ensure active participation.


Facilitation is the art of creating a space where people can make connections and build powerful ideas. There are several participatory processes you can use to make collective decisions, design projects, and/or tap into the wealth of knowledge and experience that is present in the room.
