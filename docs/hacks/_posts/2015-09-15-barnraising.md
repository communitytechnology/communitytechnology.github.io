**Barn Raising** is a method of coming together to build common infrastructure or undertake collective work. The word comes from a community gathering to build a barn, but similar practices exist around the world--the words *minka* in Quechua and *naffir* in Sudanese Arabic have a similar meaning. Many community networks have been built using this method. The basic idea is that neighbors gather together for several days to build something that would be difficult to build alone. Recently, people held barn raising events for [Fuma√ßa Data Springs](http://nuvem.tk/wiki/index.php/Convocat%C3%B3ria_-_Fuma%C3%A7a_Data_Springs), [Mesh Sayada](http://communitytechnology.github.io/docs/blog/case-study-mesh-sayada/), Mesh Goma and Mesh Bukavu.
