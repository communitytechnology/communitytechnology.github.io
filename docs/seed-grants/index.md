Through the Community Technology Partnership, the Open Technology Institute and the Detroit Community Technology Project have provided seed grants to 11 community-controlled infrastructure projects this year.

Digital communication and technology has been an important tool for enhanced local community media, improved transparency, and organizing on social justice issues. However, technology has also been used within systems of control to enhance surveillance, decrease personal privacy, aggregate the control and creation of information, and exacerbate disparities between groups that have the resources to benefit from a new technology-based economy and those that do not.

To resist these systems, people continue to build community-based technology projects and demonstrate an alternative vision. We find these small acts of resistance to digital control in neighborhoods, small towns, and rural areas around the world inspiring and rich with lessons in what the role of technology can be to restore neighborhoods, build new relationships, and develop new systems that encourage collaboration and creativity.

We focused on projects using a community organizing process to plan, build and govern shared communications infrastructure. Each of the projects has a common vision of community technology and digital justice that includes:

- Mutual learning that encourages practice and action, investigation and listening
- Participatory planning and collaborative design
- Collective self-governance

Each of the partners received $10,000 in support of their projects. The 2015 Community Technology Partners are:

**AlterMundi, Argentina**    
[AlterMundi](http://www.altermundi.net) is an organization that researches, experiments and disseminates technologies and practices that facilitate the development of a sustainable society, tending to the common good and in harmony with the environment. They will document the technical and social aspects of their successful network so others may replicate their model, and will add support for local applications to LibreMesh, an open source mesh firmware. 

**Alternative Solutions For Rural Communities, Chin State, Myanmar**    
This project will build the capacity and stability of an existing community network established by the organization, and allow them to add local server content and increase digital literacy training. 

**Collective of Community Radio and TV in North Kivu (CORACON), Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo**    
Building on their network of community media partners, CORACON will facilitate the establishment of a community network to support the creation of local digital media content and sharing of educational content. The network will provide a chat communication platform, radio programming, and educational resources in French. In partnership with Free Press Unlimited. 

**Falanster, Belarus**    
[Falanster](http://falanster.by) was founded to create the foundation and conditions for sustainable development of civil and cultural side of our society through use of digital technologies. Falanster is establishing a Mesh Club to share information and practice about wifi and mesh networks in our society. 

**Fantsuam Foundation, Kafanchan, Nigeria**   
 [Fantsuam Foundation](http://www.fantsuam.net/) will link six rural communities together and will provide services including: telephony, local government budgeting and education. The project will also rebuild the Fantsuam solar system. To maintain the network, Fantsuam will train a new generation of wireless and solar technicians. 


**School of Computing University of Namibia (UNAM) and Glowdom Educational Foundation (GEF), Connecting Eenhana, Namibia**    
Staff and students at UNAM are in partnership with GEF, an NGO  that works to support learning amongst community members of the small town of Eenhana and surrounding villages. The project aims to support generating and sharing local content and to increase access of schools to educational content, including for learners and students at a Special school for Deaf learners. It also enables UNAM's students to apply their technical knowledge in the real world in supporting local technological empowerment. The evolving network includes an intranet of digital content, analog telephony, a digital noticeboard and solar-powered nodes.
